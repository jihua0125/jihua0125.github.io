                    <h6>Across the game of basketball, players, coaches, and fans almost unanimously believe in the “hot-hand” phenomena: sometimes a player simply can’t miss. This phenomena is easily understood in the game of basketball, but describes in general a pattern in the human decision making process. We often attribute recent and consistent success at work, school, or some other activity to something beyond chance by saying “That person is on fire.”
                        <br><br> Until recently, the “Hot Hand Theory” was touted as the “Hot Hand Fallacy” by prominent cognitive psychologists and statisticians, chalked to an example of humans’ tendency to misunderstand randomness. Specifically, people tend to assume that the Law of Large Numbers applies to local trials, or a fallacious “Law of Small Numbers.”

                        In our project, we are going to test if the hot hand theory is a true phenomena or just based on luck. Our work flow is showed bellow:

                <br>
            </div>
            <h3 align="left">Basic Data</h3>
            <h6>To examine this theory, we used the data from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/nba-shot-logs">Kaggle</a>, including the 2013-2014 Season NBA stats.
                The data includes a lot of detailed information about one shot, such as game index, matchup, match results, player name, technological stats about the shot (points, shot type, result, shot time, distance, etc.).
                The original data is 128070 rows times 21 columns.
            </h6>
            <br>
            <h3 align="left">Extra Data</h3>
            <h6>Though the original data set contains a lot of information about the shots, however, the information about the players themselves are not included. To get extra information such as height, weight, age and so on, we
                scrapped data from the following website: <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/">http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/</a>.
            </h6>
        </div>
        <div class = "container">
            <h3 align="left">Exploratory Analysis</h3>
            <h6> First, we would like to see how the shot accuracy and numbers of shots per player per game distributed across the data.
                This is because we need to decide how much shots a player made per game can give reliable information.
                For example, if a player only plays very few matches in that season, his stats are not reliable due to randomness.
                Also, if the player made only one shot or two, we cannot determine the next goal based on previous shot or purely luck for lacking the empirical knowledge.
                The following histograms showed the distribution of numbers of matches the players played and how many shots they made in each game.
                The scatter plot shows the relationship of accuracy over numbers of attempts.
                Since the minimum number of games is 27, those data are quite reliable.
                By the scatter plot of accuracy over numbers of attempts, we get some intuitive understanding of the data.
                We found that the high-attempts shooters have more stable accuracy than the low-attempts shooters. The shooters has small amounts are more likely to have extreme accuracy (0% or 100%).
                This enlightens us to consider these two kinds of players differently. Based on the mean of shots per game, we divided players in two groups:
                high-volume shooters (attempts to shoot more than mean per game) and low-volume shooters (attempts to shoot less than mean per game).

            <h3 align="left">Data Wrangling</h3>
            <h6> The original data set has many details about each shot in each game. Some of them are useful while some of them are not.
                Besides, some of the features need to be transformed into categorical or ordinal variables.
                The following image shows how we deal with the features.

                <h3 align="left">Streak Matrix</h3>
                <h6> The data is recorded sequentially but independently.
                    So, we need to transform the shot results into a sequence instead of original format.
                    For example, if player A made 6 shots in game 1, the first 2 are missed, and the following 3 made goals and the last shot missed the target again, we will transform this into a string of 001110.
                    After this, we calculated the last “streak” of each shot. We tried 3 different measuremetns of streak.
                    <li><b>Consecutive streak:</b>
                        Using the same example, for the first shot, there is no previous knowledge, then we record this as (0,0), means 0 misses and 0 goals previously.
                        The second one will be (1,0), means 1 misses before and currently on miss “streak”. The third and fourth ones shall be (2,0) and (0,1) and go on.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Shot confidence streak:</b>
                        Based on the data, we found that it has a very low probability of missing consecutive 4 or more shots (Pr=0.0448<0.05).
                        So we used shot confidence to measure if the player missed all previous 4 shots or not.
                        This is will set to 1 if the player made at least 1 shots of the 4 shots. Otherwise, it will be 0.
                        Instead of measuring how hot is the player, we consider this as measurement of "cold hand".
                    </li>

                    </div>
                    <li><b>Previous shot percentage streak:</b>
                        This is similar to previous one. Instead of binary value, we used the percentage to measure how many goals are made in previous 4 shots.
                    </li>

                <b>Streak metrics do not have large effect on model prediction</b>
                The current models do not show significant differences in accuracy when the streak metrics are included in the predictor set.
                This may be due to the fact that streaks tend to be rare, therefore only making up a small percentage of the total dataset.
                However, among the basic predictor set, the shot confidence metric was most influential.
                <br>
                <b>Biometric data does not significantly affect model prediction</b>
                The biometric data, contrary to intuition, did not affect the overall prediction accuracy of the model when added to the baseline predictor set.
                However, in the presence of the biometric data, the shot confidence metric and previous shot percentage metric were found to account for a small portion of the output.
                <br>
                <b>Streaks play a significant role in predicting better players’ shots</b>
                Attempted shots is a good standard by which to measure how good a player is.
                Better offensive players are given more opportunities to shoot. Models built on better players’ data
                (those taking over 9 shots per game) showed significant increases in accuracy with the addition of streak metrics.

                There are still some other factors can influence our results.  The following are examples:
                <b>Game-by-game effects</b>
                It is likely that team matchups have a significant effect on streaks: a good team against a bad team will be most likely score more easily.
                <br>
                <b>Optimal binning of shot clock/game clock</b>
                It is possible that the range of the time data confounds our model. Binary encoding may help.
                <br>
                We could explore these in the future.
